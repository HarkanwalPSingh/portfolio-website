# Modern Portfolio Website

A complete redesign and rebuild of my personal portfolio, transitioning from a legacy React template to a modern, performant, and accessible web application.

## Project Overview

This project represents a comprehensive modernization effort, replacing an outdated portfolio with a cutting-edge solution that showcases both technical skills and design sensibility.

### Key Objectives
- **Modern Technology Stack**: Leverage the latest web technologies for optimal performance
- **Design System**: Create a cohesive, scalable design language
- **Content Management**: Implement a flexible, type-safe content system
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance and excellent UX for all users
- **Performance**: Achieve excellent Core Web Vitals scores
- **Developer Experience**: Maintain high code quality and development velocity

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Frontend Framework: Next.js 15**
- App Router for modern routing paradigms
- Static Site Generation for optimal performance
- Built-in optimizations for images, fonts, and scripts
- Turbopack for lightning-fast development builds

**Type Safety: TypeScript**
- Strict mode configuration for maximum type safety
- Custom utility types for component props
- Integration with Contentlayer for content type generation

**Styling: Tailwind CSS 3**
- Custom design system with CSS variables
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Component variants using class-variance-authority

**Content: Contentlayer 2**
- MDX support with syntax highlighting
- Type-safe content queries
- Automatic slug generation and metadata
- Hot reloading for content changes

### Component Architecture

Created a comprehensive component library with:

```typescript
// Example: Accessible Button component
interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: 'default' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'destructive';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'icon';
  asChild?: boolean;
}

export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
    const Comp = asChild ? Slot : "button";
    return (
      <Comp
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  }
);
```
