# About Me

Hi there! I'm **Harkanwalpreet Singh**, a Senior Software Engineer currently working at Twilio, with over 6 years of experience in building large-scale distributed systems, privacy-compliant architectures, and high-performance backend solutions. My journey in tech has been driven by a passion for solving complex technical challenges while delivering significant business impact.

## What I Do

Currently at **Twilio** as a Senior Software Engineer (L3), I work across multiple high-impact areas:

### Privacy & Compliance Systems
- Implemented **Consent in Engage (Public Beta)** enabling GDPR compliance for user data preferences
- Re-architected **Deletion Orchestration Reporting** systems, eliminating data loss incidents
- Optimized Redis usage in Privacy Systems ensuring **100% detection of PII classifications**

### Large-Scale Performance Optimization
- **Implemented key components** of the Batch-to-Realtime Compute Migration project projected to **reduce company COGS by ~$6M annually**; owned design of control plane RPC changes and Conductor workflow orchestration
- Optimized SQL queries in Batch Compute reducing **DPU costs by up to 80%** and execution times by **up to 95%** (15 hours → 45 minutes)
- Designed a resumable S3 offset reader for Realtime backfills, enabling continuation from failure points and saving days of reprocessing during interruptions

### AI/ML & Media Processing
- **Led development of Generative AI Captioning** from POC to production, integrating OpenAI APIs and evolving prompt strategies; adopted by multiple enterprise clients
- Built a media transcription & translation pipeline (AWS MediaConvert + message queues + OpenAI Whisper API) producing WebVTT captions at scale
- Developed cache invalidation system (Redis Hash + Cloudflare APIs) enabling instant media updates, unlocking partnerships with news publishers requiring near-real-time content delivery

### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Go, Scala, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Bash, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Node.js, React, FastAPI, Finatra, Conductor, Airflow, Spark, Hadoop
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Step Functions, Kinesis), Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform
- **Data & Streaming**: Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch, Trino, Snowflake, Databricks, Athena

## My Journey

### Twilio (2024 - Present) - Senior Software Engineer (L3)
Currently working across **Governance** and **Compute** teams, focusing on privacy systems, cost optimization, and large-scale migrations. Key achievements include implementing GDPR-compliant Consent systems, re-architecting deletion orchestration systems, and implementing key components of a compute migration project projected to save the company ~$6M annually.

### Bazaarvoice (2022 - 2024) - Senior Software Engineer (L3)
Worked on the **Social Commerce Team** where I designed and implemented GDPR-compliant deletion orchestrator systems using AWS Step Functions and DynamoDB. Led development of Generative AI Captioning from POC to production, built media transcription & translation pipelines, and reduced storage costs by 20% through implementing S3 retention policies and content tracking systems.

### Morgan Stanley (2019 - 2022) - Software Engineer II/I
Started in the **Data Distribution Team** designing and delivering data distribution APIs for financial reporting with Redis caching, ETL for PII masking, and scalable data link APIs. Later joined the **ETL team** where I built Teradata query simulators, enhanced internal ETL tools, and led migration of legacy ETL systems (Informatica → in-house tool) including recruiting and mentoring contractors and defining migration strategy.

### Capgemini (2018 - 2019) - Software Analyst
Automated HR reporting dashboards by integrating Tableau with Python and completed comprehensive Core Java training, laying the foundation for my backend engineering career.

## Recognition & Impact

My work has been recognized across all organizations where I've contributed:

- **Twilio** - Operational Spotlight (Q2 2025)
- **Bazaarvoice** - Global Engineering Recognition, Global Gong Award  
- **Morgan Stanley** - Highest Rated Employee (two consecutive years)

## Education

**Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BHU, Varanasi** (2014 - 2018)
- Strong foundation in computer science and engineering principles
- Developed analytical thinking and problem-solving skills

## Philosophy

I believe in building systems that deliver both **technical excellence** and **business impact**:

> **Performance at Scale** - Every optimization should consider both immediate gains and long-term scalability.

> **Privacy by Design** - In today's data-driven world, privacy and compliance must be foundational, not afterthoughts.

> **Cost-Conscious Engineering** - Great engineering considers not just functionality but also operational costs and resource efficiency.

> **Continuous Innovation** - Staying current with emerging technologies while maintaining proven system reliability.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss challenging technical problems, system architecture, performance optimization, or explore new opportunities. Whether you have a complex scaling challenge, want to discuss privacy-compliant architectures, or are interested in collaboration, feel free to reach out!
